# Employee Tracker

## Description

This is a program an employer can use to populate and edit a database of his departments, roles, and employees.

In using this, the user is presented with a menu of options. Depending on what they choose, they are presented either with tables of data, or new options to create or edit existing data.

## Tasks

For this project, I was not given any starter code. I had to create the schema necessary for the database, seeds to populate the data, and the javascript file that controls everything.
